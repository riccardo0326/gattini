# Gattini (static PWA)

Cozy pixel-art PWA made for Virginia. Runs fully offline after first load; no backend or messaging. 
Fully customizable, made for Christmas gift to my gf.

## Run locally
- From `frontend/`, serve statically (e.g., `python3 -m http.server 4173`).
- Open `http://localhost:4173`; the service worker caches assets for offline use.

## Play
- Control Virginia’s cat with the keyboard (left/right).
- Riccardo’s cat idles nearby.
- When the cats collide, a random encouraging message appears. Close the message to continue exploring.
